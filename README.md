# 🐧 Data Analysis of 200 Penguins from Antarctica
A statistical exploration of Antarctic penguin morphology using R

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project examining 200 penguins from three species (Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo) across Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen Islands in Antarctica.  
The analysis was originally completed as part of a coursework assignment during my MSc Bioinformatics program. I decided to upload it here because the dataset is fascinating, and the project demonstrates practical applications of R in statistical modelling and biological data interpretation.

## 🔍 Key findings

* **Although Adelie penguins are found on all three islands, this pattern is unlikely to be explained by stronger swimming abilities.**  
  Their flipper length and flipper-to-body-mass ratios are not higher than those of Chinstrap or Gentoo penguins.

* **All three species show positive correlations among the four morphological variables** (bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass).  
  These patterns also suggest that morphological measurements can be used to distinguish male and female penguins, with each species relying on different key traits.

* **Penguins on the three islands do show differences in physical traits, but these differences are largely driven by species composition rather than environmental factors.**  
  When controlling for species (e.g., analysing Adelie alone), the island-level differences disappear—indicating that “island effects” are actually “species effects.”

Here are 199 of the penguins included in the analysis (the remaining one is featured in the title):
